<blockquote cite="https://ng.investing.com/">Thereâ€™s a lot of controversy over AI. The passion of those for and against its propagation is almost religious in nature, with zealots and heretics. The zealots believe that AI is a revolutionary technological innovation that will quickly transform our lives for the better, and a good development for humanity. A few of these believers do concede that it has the potential to be evil, turning against its creators.

The heretics say that AI certainly is artificial but is not intelligent. Some of them say it never will be intelligent. It is basically a statistical probability model that can digest huge amounts of information from the Internet but lacks the ability to recognize and correct its own mistakes, which is a key attribute of intelligence.
